<h4>Abstract</h4>
<br/>
The World Wide Web is a huge source of information and knowledge. But most of
these are of little use when it comes to automated manipulation of the data because
of their unstructured nature. Nowadays approach towards storing web content
semantically is providing a great deal of meaningful data which can be used for
automated data manipulation. Wikipedia, social networks like Twitter, Facebook,
Google knowledge directory are some of the huge semantic web data. We are
having a rapid increase of web users here in Bangladesh but unfortunately, the
local Bangla websites are very unstructured. Even some of the best search engines
are inefficient for retrieving data from these web contents. So a semantic approach
towards building structured web content from now on will provide opportunities
to the automated machines to manipulate more meaningful data. Guiding users
towards more meaningful queries will certainly enhance the efficiency of search
engines. Our goal is to create semantic knowledge on Bangla keywords to guide
users for more efficient web data retrieval.
