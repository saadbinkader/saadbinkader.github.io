            A typical day at work for me involves: construing business models, providing robust, scalable, and maintainable
            architectural solutions, reviewing produced code by our team to ensure top-tier industry standards, and of course,
            the very thing software developers live for; writing code! I am responsible for the contribution quality of our team
            to the business development, side-by-side, ensuring the professional growth for each team member.

            <a class="content-link" href="https://www.du.ac.bd">University of Dhaka.</a>

            a congenial environment, engaging majors, challenging extracurricular activities like collegiate programming contests,
            and exciting pastimes like indoor/outdoor sports.

            I am passionate about “good old” Software Architectures, Design Patterns, Data Structures, Algorithms, and related genres.
            So, if you have a problem that is a head-scratcher or a solution that is a jaw-dropper, I am all ears!
